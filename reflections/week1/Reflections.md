Cybernetics Serendipity

- Art exhibition mounted at Institute of Contemporary Arts in the summer of '68.
- Main motive behind the exhibition was to illustrate the relationship between computer and art and how "modern" technology could be used to expand the limits of art.
- Computer Graphics, music and other "interactive" art was also demonstrated along with the works of Peter Zinocieff (electronic music) and Gordon Pask (colloquy of mobiles).
- The artifacts did not mention whether they were created by artists/poets or by engineers/scientists.
- The second significant fact that these new media enabled totally new people to come and contribute towards it.
- The labels that the people are irrevocable sterotypes, like engineers may not be creative and artists don't know anything about technology. But with the help of new technological advancements these labels become useless.
- In these modern times majority of the people are not surprised if a piece of art is created by computers. The layman is often "mislead" using emotions.
- Two different texts were used one with technical term for experts and other avoiding them for laymen.
- The processes involved in making computer art are best suited to those who follow some sort of "algorithm" to create the art.
- The possiblities of the use of computers in arts is beyond comprehension. The computer is not just merely a tool.
- The computer as a medium is very limited in visual arts and poetry.
- Richard Lohse set down the rules for "Progressive Art".
- William Turnbull tried to predict an artist's idea for their future works using computer.

Symbols

- Renaissance algebrist Franciscus Vieta demonstrated the power of symbols. Medieval mathematicians only used natural numbers.
- Using letters to replace numbers to represent equations, helped created a symbolic solution, where the magnitude of the letters didn't matter.
- The use of symbols removed the need to look at the magnitudes leading to a powerful abstraction.
- The symbols are different from what they represent, and are easier to use and reproduce.
- Symbolic structures enables the application of formal reasoning to many more kinds of operand which are not just magnitudes.
- The technology for processing symbolic structures should be a powerful means of abstraction like the computer.
- Initially pictorial representation was the only symbolic representation present. But once developed the linear sequence of phonetic characters were the dominant one.
- Images appeal to the greatest range of people but they are also one of the hardest format to manage. They don't follow rules of conventional syntax.
- Same sign and symbols can be used for different meaning depending upon the context.
- It is possible to formally process symbols and that too in a machine, that is what a programming language is. But it differs greatly from natural language where there is no such highly restricted set of rules.
- Mathematics and music both come under the paradigm of formal notation which have a symbol scheme to differentiate the symbols, unlike a sketch.
